# Verahelm Decision Envelope v0.9.0

This release strengthens adoption and review readiness without expanding the
private-engine disclosure boundary.

Included:

- offline schema, signature, lifecycle, and context-binding verification;
- a verification-only GitHub Action;
- fictional conformance fixtures;
- a local CLI and digest-only adapter;
- a five-minute fictional demonstration;
- bounded `status` and string-boolean `valid` Action outputs;
- a dependency-free CLI package with no lifecycle scripts.
- tested digest-only mappings for Promptfoo, OPA, SARIF, Sigstore references,
  and SLSA provenance references;
- a documented DSSE and in-toto semantic mapping;
- a local, opt-in, aggregate-only measurement tool;
- in-memory negative controls for the default-deny release boundary;
- deterministic parser and canonicalization property tests;
- pinned CodeQL analysis and automated workflow dependency review;
- a bounded design-partner pilot and enterprise review sheet;
- a concrete technical repository preview;
- an Apache-2.0 path for compatible public verifier implementations.

The release does not contain Verahelm's hosted decision engine, private methods,
customer material, or real engine output. Verification authenticates the
published envelope and its declared bindings; it does not establish that the
underlying evidence is true or sufficient.

## Verify

```bash
gh release download v0.9.0 --repo Verahelm/verahelm-decision-envelope
sha256sum --check SHA256SUMS
gh attestation verify verahelm-decision-envelope-0.9.0.tar.gz --repo Verahelm/verahelm-decision-envelope
gh attestation verify verahelm-decision-envelope-0.9.0.tgz --repo Verahelm/verahelm-decision-envelope
```

`SOURCE_COMMIT` identifies the exact source revision. The immutable GitHub
release attestation binds the tag, source commit, and attached assets. The
additional build attestation records the release workflow that produced them.
